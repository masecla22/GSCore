This repo DOESN'T CONTAIN THE PLUGIN. Just the api.

# What is GSCore?
GSCore is a core plugin that aims to replace essentials and remove useless functionality. Also Essentials is extremely intrusive and cluttered. At this points I am trying to get it that fixed. If you enjoy my work please consider buying this plugin [https://www.mc-market.org/resources/8836/](here)
